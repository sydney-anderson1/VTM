## General Information
- This project was used to complete a homework assignment for my Digital Product Management course at the University of Iowa.
- The purpose of this assignment was to create a Flask website and then add on DevOps Pipeline to automatically run automated tests and deploy to Microsoft Azure.


## Technologies Used
- For this project, I used GitHub Desktip, Visual Studio Code, and Azure Web Apps.


## Setup
- README 2.md describes the process used for cloning the template repository and using the virtual environment to create flask application.
- requirements.txt contains the necessary engines that are used in the code.
- app.py has the app routes and functions for estimation calculations and app routes.
- The templates folder contains the .html for each page.
- The static folder has the css styling sheet.
- The tests folder provides the functional and unit tests that were used for DevOps.
- .github/workflows shows the yaml code for build, test, and deploy.


## Acknowledgements
Thank you to Michael Colbert and the Tippie College of Business Analytics Department. I would not have had exposure to this assignment and information if I didn't take the Digital Product Management course that the Unviersity offered.
